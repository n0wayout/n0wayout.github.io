This page presents what I expect when sponsoring a package. Be warned
that I will be picky. Other sponsors may have different requirements.

I may spend a lot of time to review your package. I expect you to
maintain it during its whole lifetime. If it hits a stable release,
you will have to maintain it for at least three years. If you just
seek to maintain _any_ package, have a look at the list of
[Work-Needing and Prospective Packages][wnpp] instead of uploading
some random package. We also have a lot of teams suffering from lack
of people.

# How to seek sponsorship

 - If there is a [packaging team][] that would fit the subject of your
   package, you should request sponsorship through them. This is
   usually easier than traditional sponsorship. For example, if you
   are packaging a Python module, join the
   [Debian Python Modules Team][DPMT].
 - Use [mentors.debian.net][] and carefully read the
   [introduction][mentors-intro]. Publish your package through this
   platform and use the provided RFS template. File a bug report
   against `sponsorship-requests` pseudo-package as explained on the
   site. You can only send me the request directly if I have sponsored
   one of your packages in the past.

# Technical checklist

 - I only accept `3.0 (quilt)` format packages.
 - I don't mind if you use **CDBS** or **debhelper**. However, if you
   use _debhelper_, I expect you to use `dh` command sequencer and use
   override targets. Also, I expect `debian/rules` to be as small as
   possible. Remove any unneeded comments and try to use files likes
   `debian/manpages` or `debian/install`.
 - The package must be **lintian-clean**. Use `lintian -viI` to check
   this. If you are really sure that _lintian_ is wrong, you can add
   an override. If you are not running _Debian unstable_, consider
   using a chroot. There are tools like [schroot][] that should help.
 - I expect a [machine-readable `debian/copyright` file][dep5].
 - All patches must contain meta-information as defined in the
   [Patch Tagging Guidelines][dep3].
 - A `debian/watch` file is mandatory. If you cannot provide one for
   some reason, just create it with a comment explaining why.
 - The package must be built in a **clean unstable chroot**. Learn how
   to use [cowbuilder][] for this purpose. It is quite easy. Really.
 - Be careful with the **description**. The short description should
   tell exactly what the purpose of the package is. Avoid unneeded
   words. The long description can explain the features of the package
   and how it is different of other packages.

When iterating on your package, keep only one entry in the
changelog. If this is a new package, don't explain all the changes: we
don't care. If this is an update to a new package, explain all the
changes since the last uploaded version.

Happy hacking!
