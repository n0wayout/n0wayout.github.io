[Dashkiosk][] is a solution to manage dashboards on multiple
displays. It comes in four parts:

 1. A **server** will manage the screens by sending URL to be
    displayed. A web interface enables an administrator to configure
    groups of dashboards and attach them to a set of displays.

 2. A **receiver** runs in a browser attached to each screen. On
    start, it contacts the server and waits for the URL to display.

 3. An **Android application** provides a simple fullscreen webview to
    display the receiver.

 4. A **Chromecast custom receiver** which will run the regular
    receiver to display dashboards using Google Chromecast
    devices. The server is able to drive Chromecast devices through
    [nodecastor][], a reimplementation of the sender API.

For a demo, have a look at the following video (it is also available
as an [Ogg Theora video][ogv]).
